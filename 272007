    <thetext>As an architect (developer), I want to maintain a list of all packages and repositories used by the system, so that a clear understanding of the system may be shared by the team, deployers, and other stakeholders.

Added by Richard:

This list should includes all code we maintain, and all packages we use that are not normal parts of the platforms we support.

The list should focus on code repositories, where they are and whether they are maintained by us or are upstream to us.

Listing all the binary package names is not so interesting.

In the mintutils package there is a script that gets almost all of our code. Making that script complete could be an alternative to a wiki page.

We also need a list of the build dependencies and where they came from.</thetext>
