    <thetext>This is an intermittent bug which has become even more intermittent with OBS 2.3, but still occurs occasionally. Islam said he sees it about once per week.

For some reason OBS sometimes responds with a success code but an empty body, and then osc (or python-buildservice) fails when trying to parse the response.

Upstream won't accept this bug without further debugging info since they can't reproduce it.

We should fix it by having osc retry when it gets an empty response, and in such a case it should log the full transaction (request and response, plus headers for both) so that we can submit a proper bug upstream. (If it gets an empty response twice in a row then it should give up and pass it back to the caller, to avoid hammering the server.)

Complication: osc's http functions may not know whether a response is expected or not. I think OBS is supposed to respond with at least a status element with code=ok if it has nothing else to say, but this should be verified.

    <thetext>This appears as an osc error sometimes.

I think it warrants a catch and retry in the buildservice library</thetext>

    <thetext>Wasn't this just a configuration error that's now solved? The exception happened only once, when the process was being set up.

I don't think it can be debugged if it's not happening anymore. Robogrator logs from that timeframe are gone so we don't even know what process definition was running.</thetext>
