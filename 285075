    <thetext>There are usually multiple configurations of interest for a project, and it will make sense to build and test more than one as part of handling a submit-request.

The purpose of this task is to define an interface (probably a set of workitem fields) that allow the process definition to detect this and start multiple concurrent image builds. This interface should then be demonstrated and tested by writing a process definition that does this.</thetext>
