    <thetext>We have a user who wants to check that the source package successfully built against a more restrictive project than the one being promoted to.

The straightforward fix to allow this would be to accept a :target or :targetproject parameter that overrides the selection of the target project.

Build trial group might also need this workaround.</thetext>
