    <thetext>The outcome of 292941 was that there is no current way to simulate a deletion request.

The decision is to patch this functionality into OBS.

The outcome of this task could be :

* If a package is marked deleted from a project link mark it as deleted and make sure their reverse dependencies get rebuilt / or are marked as unresolved

* Some way of resetting the package status to that of the link target project.</thetext>
