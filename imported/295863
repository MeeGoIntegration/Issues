    <thetext>Our current workflow requires the source project of a request to have repo publishing enabled on all repos that are considered in the request (that is, those that are linked to the target project).

If we drop this requirement then our users can save some space by disabling repo publishing on projects that don't need full repositories. (The package files are still available by querying OBS)

The reason we have the requirement is so that we can check the repo published state to determine if building is complete, before running prechecks (including check_package_built_at_source). To drop it, we'll need some other way to do this.

Comment from Islam: is_repo_published already knows when building is done even if the repo is unpublished. The problem is in the check_has_valid_repo participant.</thetext>
