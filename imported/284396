    <thetext>We need to be careful about incoming data in the workitem fields. The process definition is flexible and we can't be sure that all of it comes from trusted admins.

We should review all current participants with an eye open for:
 - use of workitem data to construct filenames
 - use of workitem data on command lines that go through the shell
 - passing of workitem data to helper programs that might not be careful with it
 - inclusion of unquoted workitem data in submissions to other systems
   (for example as header fields or snippets of xml)

In addition, if we unpack an archive that we can't necessarily trust, we should be careful about what's inside it. Check for:
 - opening files that might be symlinks
 - traversing pathnames that might be symlinks

The scope of the task is low level security: is it possible to feed in a workitem that will take over the build system or expose sensitive data?

Questions of authorization for normal operations are a different problem.</thetext>
