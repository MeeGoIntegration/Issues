    <thetext>There is existing participant for OTS testing, but the status and suitability of that is unclear.

This is would be the "send_to_ots" participant</thetext>

    <thetext>Fixed typo in description.

I added 5 hours to the estimate because this is one of the more complicated participants to write tests for, and it's also the only one that uses separate python modules.

15 hours is what we seem to spend even on average participants so I don't think it's too high.</thetext>
