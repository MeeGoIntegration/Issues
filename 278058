    <thetext>make_participant was renamed install.

Edit by Richard:

Change all remaining uses of make_participant.
Check boss-skynet, boss-python-skynet, revs and imger.
Especially update docs.

boss-standard-workflow is already clean, and the participant packages that went into boss-standard-workflow don't have to be updated.

As a last step, remove support for skynet make_participant.
(It's better to get that over with right away)</thetext>
