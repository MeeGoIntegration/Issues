    <thetext>Create a package (probably in boss-standard-workflow) that sets up a working boss machine with default components: boss, skynet, standard workflow and its participants, boss-viewer, rabbitmq. No imger or obs or bugzilla, since those are likely to be on separate machines.

(Rabbitmq might be on a separate machine, but I don't think we should make deployment more complicated just to make installing it optional. Someone who wants to use a different rabbitmq server can just turn off the one installed by this package.)

Estimated at a full day because testing the deployment package will probably involve modifying the mint-appliance build to use it.</thetext>
