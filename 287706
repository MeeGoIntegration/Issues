    <thetext>Pretty much everything that's currently in the .conf file for BOSS_handle_SR could instead be configured in project attributes in OBS. This would be a much better interface for our users.

It will need more thorough security checking, though. One thing that will help is constraining the attribute values, for example prechecks should be chosen from a specific list.</thetext>
